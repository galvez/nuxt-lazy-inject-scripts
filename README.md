# nuxt-lazy-inject-scripts

This is a Nuxt 2 module that allows you to **specify when to inject scripts**, similar to [Astro's partial hydration component tags]. Nuxt 2 already offers the [`injectScripts`]() option that lets you turn off scripts completely.

This module lets you define a function which takes a callback that when executed will cause the app scripts to load.

## Usage

In **nuxt.config.js**:

```js

function after3Seconds (callback) {
  setTimeout(callback, 3000)
}

export default {
  injectScriptsWhen: after3Seconds,
}
```

The function passed to `injectScriptsWhen` needs to be a named one â€” an arrow function or an anonymous one won't work because the module relies on `Function.toString()` and `Function.name` to inject the lazy loader script into HTML files generated by Nuxt.js
